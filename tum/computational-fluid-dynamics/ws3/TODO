Things to check:
- cheeck how one can optimize computation of density and velocity
- check that D and Q definitions are unique
- restrict MLUPS computation to certain size of grids
- check Re and Ma numbers before even starting the computation to make sure that the whole model is correct
- check that input file has correct grid structure
